What is a <!DOCTYPE> Declaration in HTML?
- <!DOCTYPE> stands for "Document Type Declaration".
- It tells the browser how to interpret the HTML code — whether in standards mode or quirks mode.
- This ensures consistent rendering across different browsers.
- Without a <!DOCTYPE>, browsers may render the page in quirks mode, which can lead to inconsistent styling and layout issues.
- Syntax - <!DOCTYPE html> 
- It is an instruction to the browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
- It is not an HTML element or tag — it is a declaration.
- Quirks Mode: A compatibility mode where browsers try to behave like older versions
- Standards Mode: The browser follows the official W3C specifications for HTML, CSS, and DOM.

Where Should the <script> Tag Be Placed in an HTML Document — and Why?
- Inside <head> tag - This blocks the page rendering until the script is downloaded and executed.
- Before Closing </body> Tag -The page content loads first & scripts don’t block rendering & it improves page speed & user experience.
- Inside <head> with defer or async Attributes
    - <script src="script.js" defer></script>
    - Loads script in the background and runs it after the HTML is parsed.
    - Maintains script execution order. Best for scripts that depend on DOM being ready.
    - <script src="script.js" async></script>
    - Loads script in parallel and executes as soon as it’s ready.
    - Does not guarantee order if you have multiple scripts.
    - Good for independent, third-party scripts (e.g., analytics).

What are Block-Level, Inline, inline-block, and Semantic HTML Elements?
Block-Level Elements 
 - Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available by default.
 - <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>
 - Occupies the entire width of its parent container.
 - It can contain other block-level or inline elements.
Inline Elements
 - Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. 
 - <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, <label>, <input> (some types)
 - It cannot contain block-level elements.
 - Mostly used for styling text or inserting small elements within text.
Inline-Block Elements
 - Inline-block elements are rendered like inline elements, but they behave like block elements in terms of accepting 
   box model properties like width, height, padding, and margin.
 - There are no native inline-block elements in HTML, but any element can be made inline-block using CSS
Semantic HTML Elements
 - Semantic HTML elements clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. 
 - These elements help with accessibility and SEO by giving structure and context.
 - <article>, <section>, <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <aside>, <main>, <figure>, <figcaption>
 ====================================================================================================================================
Will a webpage still work without using semantic tags? What are the implications for accessibility and SEO?
- Yes, a webpage will still work technically without semantic HTML tags
- browsers can still render the content using non-semantic tags like <div> and <span>
- However, not using semantic tags has important implications, especially for accessibility and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
- Using just <div> and <span> can build any layout or content structure, but they don’t communicate meaning. 
  Semantic tags add context which is vital for: Screen Readers
==================================================================================================================
Can a <section> tag be placed inside a <div>? What are best practices?
- Yes, a <section> tag can absolutely be placed inside a <div> — and it is valid HTML.
- A <div> is a non-semantic container used purely for layout or grouping.
- A <section> is a semantic element used to define a thematic grouping of content.
- Use <section> for meaningful groupings of related content with a heading
- Each <section> should ideally have a heading (<h1>–<h6>).
- Prefer <div> for styling/layout only
===================================================================================================================
Can you apply width in span tag, take one div and span tag- apply width in both
- By default, the <span> tag is inline, and inline elements do not respect width, height, padding-top/bottom, or margin-top/bottom`.
- <div> is a block element, and block elements do respect width.
- The <span> will not obey the width unless you change its display to inline-block or block.
=====================================================================================================================
Which HTML tags are considered inline elements?
- Inline elements:
    - Do not start on a new line.
    - Only take up as much width as necessary.
    - Cannot set width, height, margin-top, or margin-bottom (unless display is changed)
- Common Inline HTML Elements
    - span, a, img, input, b, strong, i, label, select, textarea, code, time.
- Inline elements can be nested inside block elements.
- but block elements should not be placed inside inline elements.
- We can style inline elements using display: inline-block or display: block if we need to apply width/height.

What techniques or tags are used to improve accessibility in HTML?
- Accessibility (a11y) in HTML ensures your web content is usable by everyone, including people using screen readers,
  keyboard navigation, or assistive technologies.
- List of techniques and tags used to improve accessibility:
    - Use semantic elements so assistive technologies can understand page structure.
    - ARIA attributes help where semantic HTML falls short.
    - Always provide a meaningful alt attribute on <img>.
    - Proper Labeling for Forms
    - Keyboard Navigation -Use native HTML buttons and links instead of clickable <div> or <span>.
    - Maintain a logical and hierarchical structure of headings (<h1>, <h2>, …). Avoid skipping levels (e.g., <h1> followed by <h4>).
    - Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background (at least 4.5:1 for normal text).
    - Assistive tech can navigate quickly using regions: haeder, footer, main, nav
=========================================================================================================================
How do you disable an HTML element using CSS or HTML attributes?
 - Using HTML disabled attribute (preferred for form elements) Eg: <input type="text" disabled />
 - Using CSS to mimic disabling (not real disable) : CSS alone cannot truly disable an element but you can simulate it visually and behaviorally:
 - <button class="disabled-btn">Click Me</button>
 - .disabled-btn {
  pointer-events: none; /* disables clicks */
  opacity: 0.5;         /* makes it look disabled */
  cursor: not-allowed;  /* changes the mouse cursor */
}
 - Disable via JavaScript (dynamic control) - document.getElementById('myInput').disabled = true;
 - We cannot disable non-form elements (like <div>, <span>, <p>) using the disabled attribute.But we can block interaction
   using CSS:
   .blocked {
  pointer-events: none;
  user-select: none;
}
