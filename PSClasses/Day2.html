console.log(a);
var a = 5;
// o/p - undefined  variable hoist happened here but not value/assignment
//Reason: Variable a is hoisted (declaration only)

console.log(b);
let b = 10;
// o/p - Reference Error 
//Reason: let is hoisted but is in the temporal dead zone (TDZ) until the declaration is evaluated. So you can't access it before it's declared.

var c = 1;
function test() {
  console.log(c);
  var c = 2;
}
test();
// o/p- undefined - var is functional scope
//Reason: Inside test(), var a is function-scoped, so it shadows the outer a. It's hoisted inside test, so console.log(a) sees undefined.

(function(){
  console.log(typeof x);
  var x = 10;
})();
// o/p - undefined
//Reason: var x is hoisted, but not the value. So typeof x evaluates as undefined

let d = 10;
(() => {
  console.log(d);
  let d = 20;
})();
// o/p - Reference Error
//Reason: let d = 20 creates a new a in TDZ. Even though outer a exists, it’s shadowed. TDZ causes error when accessing before declaration.

console.log(null == undefined); 
// true
//Reason: Loose equality (==) treats null and undefined as equal.


console.log([] == []); 
// false
//Reason: Arrays are compared by reference, not content. Two different arrays are not equal.

console.log(typeof null); 
//object
//Reason: This is a long-standing JavaScript bug — typeof null returns "object".


for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 0); 
}
// 0,1,2
//Reason: let creates a new i for each iteration due to block scope.

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 0); 
}
// 3,3,3
//Reason: var is function-scoped, so the same i is shared. By the time the setTimeout runs, the loop has finished, and i === 3.

const obj = {
  a: 10,
  foo: function () {
    console.log(this.a); //10
  }
};
obj.foo();
//Reason: Regular function keeps the context of obj, so this.a is 10.

const obj1 = {
  a: 10,
  foo: () => {
    console.log(this.a); // undefined
  }
};
obj1.foo();
//Reason: Arrow functions do not bind this. this refers to the global object (window in browser), where a is not defined.

let a = 5;
const obj2 = {
  a: 10,
  foo: function () {
    return () => this.a;
  }
};
const arrow = obj2.foo();
console.log(arrow());//5
//Reason: Arrow function inherits this from foo (a regular function), and this in foo refers to obj2.


let a = 5;
const obj4 = {
  a: 10,
  foo:  () => {
    return () => this.a;
  }
};
const arrow = obj4.foo();
console.log(arrow()); //undefined
//Reason: Both foo and the returned arrow function inherit this from their outer (global) context. this.a is undefined globally.



function a() {
  console.log(this);//window
}
a();
// Reason: Regular function called without context defaults this to global.

"use strict";
function a() {
  console.log(this);//undefined
}
a();
//Reason: In strict mode, this in a regular function is undefined when not bound.

const obj = {
  foo() {
    return this;
  }
};
console.log(obj.foo() === obj); // true
// Reason: foo() is called as a method of obj, so this === obj.

const a = {};
const b = { key: "b" };
const c = { key: "c" };
 
a[b] = 123; 
a[c] = 456; 
 
console.log(a[b]); //456
// Reason: Object keys are coerced to strings. Both b and c become "[object Object]", so second assignment overwrites the first.

const a = {};
const b = { key: "b" };
const c = { key: "c" };
const d = 0;
a[b] = 123; 
a[c] = 456; 
a[d] = a[c]
console.log(a[d]);//456
// Reason: a[c] = 456, so a[d] = 456. Again, object keys are coerced to strings.

console.log(NaN === NaN);// false
R//Reason: NaN is not equal to anything, including itself.

const a = b = 5;
console.log(a); // 5
console.log(b); //5
// Reason: b = 5 is evaluated first, and b becomes global (in non-strict mode). Then a is const

let a, b;
a = b = 5;
console.log(typeof a, typeof b);
//"number" "number"
// Reason: b = 5 assigns 5 to global b, and then a = b. Both are numbers.
