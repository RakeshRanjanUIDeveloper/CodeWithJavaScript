Map-
 - map() is a method available on arrays in JavaScript.
 - It is used to transform each element of an array
 - It returns a new array with the same number of elements.
Syntax - 
    - const newArray = arr.map(callback(currentValue, index,array), thisArgs);
    - thisArgs - ? check in the call today
KeyPoints -
    - Does not mutate the original array.
    - Returns a new array.
    - Commonly used for transforming data,
- If we use curly braces {} but forget return, we'll get undefined in the output
- If we dont return anything then resulting array will contain undefined.
- map() can returns a nested array if each callback returns an array.
- map() skips empty slots (holes), but retains them in the result as empty slots.
