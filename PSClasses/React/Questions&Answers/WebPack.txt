WebPack
=======================================================================================================================
- Webpack is a module bundler primarily used in modern JavaScript applications.
- It  takes the many different files your project uses (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) and 
  bundles them into one or more optimized files to improve performance and manageability.
=======================================================================================================================
What is Webpack
- Webpack is a build tool that:
 - Bundles multiple JavaScript modules into a single file (or smaller chunked files).
 - Handles other file types (like CSS, images) using loaders.
 - Can transform, minify, and optimize assets.
 - Allows code splitting for lazy loading. 
=======================================================================================================================
Why is Webpack used in React Projects?
 - Compiles JSX into browser-readable JavaScript.
 - Bundles all modules (React components, styles, assets) into optimized files.

Advantages of Using Webpack in React
- Performance optimization : Minifies code, removes dead code, and reduces bundle size.
- Modularity : Supports ES Modules; enables writing clean, modular components.
- Customizable : Highly configurable to suit project needs (via webpack.config.js).
- Ecosystem compatibility : Works well with Babel, PostCSS, Sass, TypeScript, and others.
