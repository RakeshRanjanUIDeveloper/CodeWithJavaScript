Concurrent Rendering
=================================================================================================
- Concurrent Rendering is a React internal capability.
- It allows to prepare multiple UI versions at the same time and interrupt rendering when needed.
- It enables React to:
  - Pause rendering
  - Abort rendering
  - Resume rendering
  - Prioritize more important updates (like user input)
======================================================================================================
Traditional vs Concurrent Rendering
 - Traditional
   - React renders everything from top to bottom in one go.
   - If a component takes time, the UI freezes until it's done.
 - Concurrent
   - React can interrupt rendering mid-way.
   - It can skip to higher-priority tasks like clicks or typing.
   - It lets background updates finish later.

Benefits of Concurrent Rendering
- Interruptible rendering	
- Prioritization
- Background rendering	
- Better user experience	
=========================================================================================================
How Do we Enable It?
- Concurrent rendering is automatically enabled when we use features like:
    - React.lazy()	
    - startTransition()
    - useDeferredValue()
    - Suspense for data fetching
