How Many Virtual DOMs Can Be There in React at a Time?
- In React, at any given point, there are typically two virtual DOMs in memory:
- Current (Old) Virtual DOM – representing the UI before the latest update.
- Updated (New) Virtual DOM – representing the UI after the latest state or prop change.
- React compares these two virtual DOMs using a process called "reconciliation" to determine what has changed, 
  and then it updates the real DOM (browser DOM) accordingly in an efficient way.
-Usually: 2 virtual DOMs at a time:
   - One for previous render
   - One for new render
- React does not create separate virtual DOMs per component.
- React maintains a single unified virtual DOM tree that represents the entire component hierarchy at a given point in time.
