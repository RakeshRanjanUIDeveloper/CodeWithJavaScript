Controlled Forms in React
- In a controlled form, React state fully controls the form inputs.
- Input values are stored in React state and updated via event handlers.
- The inputâ€™s value prop is set by React state.
- Every change triggers a React state update and re-render.

Uncontrolled Forms in React
- In an uncontrolled form, form inputs manage their own state internally (like normal HTML inputs).
- React does not control input values via state.
- To access input values, we use refs (useRef) to get the DOM element and read values on demand (e.g., on submit).
- No re-render when input changes
