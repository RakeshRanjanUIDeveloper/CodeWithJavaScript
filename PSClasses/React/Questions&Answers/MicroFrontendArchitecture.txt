Micro Frontend Architecture
=========================================================================================================================
-Micro Frontend Architecture is a design pattern where a frontend application is split into smaller, independent pieces.
-each built, deployed, and managed separately — but together, they form a complete app.
-The concept of micro frontend comes from microservice architecture. 
-Basically, Microservice is an architecture in which an application is decomposed into small independent services 
 that can be worked independently and combined with a fully working service by combining all the services.

Characteristics of Micro Frontend Architecture
- Modularity: The application is broken into smaller, self-contained modules based on features or domains.
- Independent Development: Each team can develop, test, and deploy their micro frontend without relying on others.
- Scalability: Teams and features can scale independently as the project grows.
- Reuse and Composition: Micro frontends can be reused and composed like building blocks across different applications.
- Isolation and Fault Tolerance: A failure in one micro frontend doesn’t crash the entire application.
- Flexibility in Deployment: Micro frontends can be deployed separately without redeploying the whole app.
- Improved Performance: Only necessary micro frontends are loaded, reducing initial load time in some cases.
- Team Autonomy and Ownership: Teams have full control over the tech stack, codebase, and deployment of their micro frontend.
