1. How to call a method when a component is rendered for the first time?
 - In React (functional components), to call a method only once when the component is rendered for the first time,
 - we should use the useEffect hook with an empty dependency array [].
 - useEffect(() => { ... }, []) behaves like componentDidMount() in class components.
 - The empty array [] means "no dependencies", so the effect runs only once after the first render.
====================================
2. How to call a method on every re-render of a component?
 - There are two main ways to call a method on every render of a React functional component
 - Call the method directly inside the component body - But it Runs before the JSX is returned.
 - Use useEffect without a dependency array - But it After the componentâ€™s JSX is rendered to the DOM.
 ========================================
3. How to force a component to re-render without using useState?
 - Using useEffect with the specific state in the dependency array
 - Using useLayoutEffect for synchronous effect after DOM mutation
