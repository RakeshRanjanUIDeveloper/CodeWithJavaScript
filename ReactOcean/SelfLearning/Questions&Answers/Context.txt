About Context -
===============================================================================================================
- A way to share data across the component tree without passing props manually at every level 
- Useful for global data (like themes, auth, settings, etc.).
===============================================================================================================
When to use Context
- We need to share state or data across many components.
- want to avoid prop drilling (passing data through intermediate components).
- We are managing global concerns like:
  - Theme (dark/light)
  - Auth (logged-in user)
  - Locale/Language
  - App-wide settings
  - UI preferences (sidebar open, font size, etc.)
