const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
useReducer is a function  which return a array - 1st state, 2nd function
useReducer hook takes 2 things - reducer function and initialState
    - reducer function is place where we are going to manager all the state of the application 
    - initialState - initial value
Using dispatch, we just request to perform the operation to update the state
dispatch is a function and inside the onclick we generally directly called the dispatch function, we should not do this 
    - instead whenever we click then only dispatch has to be called
        onclick={() => dispatch('increment')} => function will be called only when the click happens.
        onclick={dispatch('increment')} => The function runs during render, not on click.
Entire state will be handled inside reducer function
We have to write reducer function outside because each and every time whenever our component is getting mount, 
    we dont want to call this reducer function, when we are requesting using dispatch only then we have to call the reducer function
reducer function takes 2 parameters (initialState, action) and return the next state
