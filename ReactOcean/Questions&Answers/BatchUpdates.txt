Asynchronous -
setState does not update the state immediately.
Instead, React schedules the update to happen later, during the next render cycle.
When multiple setState calls happen in the same synchronous event , React batches them together and performs one render instead of multiple.
React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates. 
Batched Updates - 

This improves performance by avoiding unnecessary renders.
