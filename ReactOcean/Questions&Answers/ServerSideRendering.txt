What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?
=======================================================================================================================
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) means that your React components are rendered on the server, 
  and the fully rendered HTML is sent to the browser.
- Server prepares the page, and the browser just displays it.
========================================================================================================================
Why Use SSR in React?
- Better SEO: Search engines can see your content right away
- Faster First Load: Users see the content sooner
- Sharing URLs: Social media previews work better
